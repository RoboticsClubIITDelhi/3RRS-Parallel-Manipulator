This directory contains the CAD files for the first iteration of an RRS arm.
In reality, the Spherical joint is not a true spherical joint, but rather a combination of two Revolute joints whose axes intersect orthogonally.
The Revolute joints have been made using 8 mm bore ball bearings.
The arm links have been fabricated using 5 mm thick acrylic.

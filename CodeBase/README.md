## üìÅ Software Architecture

The software for the 3RRS Parallel Manipulator project is designed with precision in mind.
It consists of two major divisions:-
1. Control System for controlling the angle of rotation of motors with the help of a PID controller
2. Inverse Kinematics to calculate the angle of rotation of the three motors for the required orientation and height of the end effector
